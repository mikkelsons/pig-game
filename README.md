### Rules:
Roll the die. If you roll an number other than a 'one', that number is added to your current turn's score. Roll as many times as you would like to increase the current turn's score. When you're ready to add your current turn's score to your permanent score, press the 'hold' buton. 

The game ends when a player reaches 100 points. 

---
**Be Careful:**
If you roll a 'one' you lose your current turn's score and your turn.
